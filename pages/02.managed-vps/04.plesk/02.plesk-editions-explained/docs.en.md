We offer three Plesk editions, each with a different domain limit and with some features (such as customer and reseller management) only offered on the higher editions

## Web Admin edition 

We include Web Admin edition for free on all our Cloud VPS plans. As the base edition, it includes a wide range of Plesk features which are suitable for most customers:

* Host up to 10 domains
* Plesk Mobile Manager: use your iPhone or Android to manage your Plesk server any time
* Outbound Antispam: protects your server IP addresses from being blacklisted due to outgoing spam
* Brute force protection: protects your server from automated attacks trying to guess your website, mail, FTP, SSH and Plesk passwords (one of the more common successful attack vectors due to users using weak passwords)

**Plesk Web Admin edition is included free of charge with all plans.**

## Web Pro edition 

This edition is aimed at web hosting professionals and digital agencies that need to design and administer a portfolio of websites – either your own or your customers.

Includes everything in Web Admin edition, plus:

* Host up to 30 domains
* Support for selling your own hosting services: full customer account, subscription and hosting plan management with Plesk ‘Service Provider’ mode
