In Plesk, you have the flexibility to easily modify PHP interpreter without experiencing any server or domain downtime. This feature can be particularly advantageous for enhancing website performance or switching to your preferred PHP interpreter, if you have one in mind! When PHP operates, it creates new files and writes to existing ones using the user it runs as.

Below are step-by-step instructions guiding you on how to change the PHP handler directly from within the Plesk Control Panel:

* From your Plesk Dashboard, scroll down to your desired domain and click on `Hosting Settings`:

* Navigate to the section labeled **Web Scripting** and select which programming and scripting languages must be interpreted by the web server.:

![How%20to%20change%20PHP%20interpreter%20in%20Plesk-2](How%20to%20change%20PHP%20interpreter%20in%20Plesk-2.png "How%20to%20change%20PHP%20interpreter%20in%20Plesk-2")

* Finally, to apply the changes you have made, please click on the `Ok` button.
