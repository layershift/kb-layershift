* Once the page has loaded you’ll need to click the button `Reset Password`  and the system will automatically generate a new password for the administrator account. The password will be emailed to both the technical and administrator contact email addresses. You will then be able to login to your Plesk Control Panel with the login name ‘admin’ and your newly generated password.

!!! NOTE: We strongly recommend that you change your password to something secure once logged in as the password was sent in plain text via email.
