Just like a PAYG mobile phone, when your balance reaches £0.00 your service will stop working, so it’s important to keep it topped up. It’s possible to do this automatically by [configuring the auto-refill options](https://kb.layershift.com/how-to-refill-your-balance-automatically) within Enscale, however, if you just want to submit a single payment read below.

You can log into your Enscale account at https://app.enscale.cloud and follow the steps below to submit a payment:

* Select `Refill Balance` from the `Refill Balance` menu:

* Use the slider to decide how much you want to top up:

The payment will then be processed and should appear on your account within a few minutes.
