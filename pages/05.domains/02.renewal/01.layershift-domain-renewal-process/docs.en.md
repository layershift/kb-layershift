!!! All Layershift domain registrations are auto-renew by default to ensure that your valuable domain stays online and registered to you!
# When are domains renewed
We auto-renew your domains 30 days prior to expiry. We do this for 2 reasons:
* To ensure that your domain remains online whilst any unexpected problems during the renewal (payment errors etc.) are resolved
* To avoid confusion arising from ICANN's mandatory renewal/expiry notices - sent to the domain registrant at one month before expiry, and again at one week before expiry

!!!! You can see the auto-renewal date for each of your domains via [https://dashboard.layershift.com](https://dashboard.layershift.com) > Domains.
# When are domain renewals invoiced
To reduce the number of invoices your accountant has to deal with, we consolidate all domain renewals arising in the same month onto one invoice.

To guarantee that at the same time as ensuring that your domains auto-renew at least 30 days prior to expiry, we:
* Take your subscription date as the 1st of the expiry month
* Process your renewal invoice 45 days before (giving a 15 day window to resolve any unexpected payment problems)

This means renewal invoices are issued 45 - 75 days before domain expiry.
# How much does domain renewal cost
The domain registries responsible for administering each TLD (domain extension) frequently adjust their registration and renewal prices. That might involve promotions to try to encourage more new registrations or renewals, or price changes to factor in changes to the operational costs of running their particular registry. Since domain registries are located around the world, pricing is fixed in their local currency which might differ to yours.

To give you the most competitive domain (registration and) renewal prices, we dynamically set our pricing according to the latest domain registry rates, promotions, and exchange rates. This ensures we always give you the best price we can for each renewal.

!!!! If the domain registry has a special promotional discount, you benefit from it automatically

We email you the renewal price for each domain renewal 14 days before issuing the renewal invoice.
# If the domain is no longer required
Simply disable auto-renewal prior to the invoice date, and the registration will lapse on the expiry date.
