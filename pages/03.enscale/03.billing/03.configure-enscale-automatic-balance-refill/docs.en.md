Just like a PAYG mobile phone, when your balance reaches £0.00 your service will stop working, so it’s important to keep it topped up. We’ve even taken the hassle out of this chore as well – just to make sure you can stay focussed on your applications and the important business activities they’re supporting.

You can log into your Enscale account at https://app.enscale.cloud and follow the steps below to submit a payment:

* Select `Configure auto-refill` from the `Balance` menu.
